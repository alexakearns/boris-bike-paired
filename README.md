 # Errors
 
 ```
NameError: uninitialized constant DockingStation
    from (irb):2
    from /home/ec2-user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.6.3/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
```

irb line 2 states : 
```
docking_station = DockingStation.new
```
This is a problem because the constant 'DockingStation' does not yet exist, or in code speak it has not been initialized.

We could solve this error by creating a constant called 'DockingStation'.
